Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you will find a collection of Python projects that I have created as part of my ongoing learning journey. 
Some of these projects are in English, while others are in Portuguese, but I believe they are all understandable regardless of language. 
I started learning Python on January 1st, so while some of the codes may look easy to more advanced users, I am still learning and improving every day.
My focus has been on building projects that use Python commands and libraries that are commonly used in the daily routines of data analysts and other professionals in
the field. I hope that these projects will serve as useful resources for anyone interested in learning more about Python and its applications in data analysis. 
Thank you for visiting! :)
